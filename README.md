# SteelEngine
C++ Engine

# Getting started
## Requirements
- VisualStudio Code
- Python version 3.7
- Compiling tools for Windows like MSVC, or for Linux like g++, Clang

## Dependencies
- LunarG Vulkan SDK
- SDL2

## Building the Engine
1. Clone the repository
2. Download the dependencies:
   - LunarG Vulkan SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/
   - SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/
3. Install the LunarG Vulkan SDK in external/Vulkan folder and the SDL2 extract to SDL2-2.0.9 folder
4. Open the downloaded folder using the VisualStudio Code
5. Just compile the source code by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+B**. If you compile first time, you need to compile it twice, because first need to build ReflectionGenerator app, so just ignore the errors...
